     ccooll -- filter reverse line feeds from input

     The ccooll utility filters out reverse (and half reverse) line feeds so that
     the output is in the correct order with only forward and half forward
     line feeds, and replaces white-space characters with tabs where possible.
     This can be useful in processing the output of nroff(1) and tbl(1).

     The ccooll utility reads from the standard input and writes to the standard
     output.

     The options are as follows:

     --bb      Do not output any backspaces, printing only the last character
             written to each column position.

     --ff      Forward half line feeds are permitted (``fine'' mode).  Normally
             characters printed on a half line boundary are printed on the
             following line.

     --hh      Do not output multiple spaces instead of tabs (default).

     --ll _n_u_m  Buffer at least _n_u_m lines in memory.  By default, 128 lines are
             buffered.

     --pp      Force unknown control sequences to be passed through unchanged.
             Normally, ccooll will filter out any control sequences from the
             input other than those recognized and interpreted by itself,
             which are listed below.

     --xx      Output multiple spaces instead of tabs.

     The control sequences for carriage motion that ccooll understands and their
     decimal values are listed in the following table:

     ESC-7            reverse line feed (escape then 7)
     ESC-8            half reverse line feed (escape then 8)
     ESC-9            half forward line feed (escape then 9)
     backspace        moves back one column (8); ignored in the first column
     carriage return  (13)
     newline          forward line feed (10); also does carriage return
     shift in         shift to normal character set (15)
     shift out        shift to alternate character set (14)
     space            moves forward one column (32)
     tab              moves forward to next tab stop (9)
     vertical tab     reverse line feed (11)

     All unrecognized control characters and escape sequences are discarded.

     The ccooll utility keeps track of the character set as characters are read
     and makes sure the character set is correct when they are output.

     If the input attempts to back up to the last flushed line, ccooll will dis-
     play a warning message.

     of ccooll as described in environ(7).

     The ccooll utility conforms to Version 2 of the Single UNIX Specification
     (``SUSv2'').
